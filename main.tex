\begin{abstract}

Abstracts should be up to 300 words and provide a succinct summary of the article. Although the abstract should explain why the article might be interesting, care should be taken not to inappropriately over-emphasize the importance of the work described in the article. Citations should not be used in the abstract, and the use of abbreviations should be minimized. If you are writing a Research or Systematic Review article, please structure your abstract into Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusions.

\section*{Keywords}

Please list up to eight keywords to help readers interested in your article find it more easily.

Take-homes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is significant variation in predicted quarantine length 
at different times and locations.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Captured by normals
  \item Climate
  \end{enumerate}
\item Variation in prediction within time / location (across years) 
is important.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Captured by day-of-year (between-year) variation
  \item Informs reliability of prediction
  \item Influenced by rare events (eg. cold snaps)
  \item Prediction based on normal temps vs normal 
  of predictions based on measured temps
  \end{enumerate}
\item DD vs ABS comparison
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item ABS is better behaved
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Seasonal swings less dramatic; 
    Much less discontinuity at beginning of autumn 
    \item Smaller overall range
    \item Captures common-sense effects missed by DD: 
    eg. extreme cold kills
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Large disagreement between DD and ABS may indicate 
  DD prediction is unreliable/broken
  \item Variance in predictions should inform management and planning.
  ABS variance is easier to interpret (KFAT being a dramatic example).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Introduction}

The format of the main body of the article is flexible: it should be concise and in the format most appropriate to displaying the content of the article.

% Some examples of commonly used \LaTeX{}  commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.


% \subsection*{Sections}

% Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.


% \subsection*{Tables}

% Use the table and tabledata commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example.
% \begin{table}[h!]
% \hrule \vspace{0.1cm}
% \caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example of a simple table with caption.}
% \centering
% \begin{tabledata}{llr} 
% \header First name & Last Name & Grade \\ 
% \row John & Doe & $7.5$ \\ 
% \row Richard & Miles & $2$ \\ 
% \end{tabledata}
% \end{table}

% \subsection*{Figures}
% You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the files menu. To include it in your document, use the includegraphics command (see the example below in the source code).

% Please give figures appropriate filenames eg: figure1.pdf, figure2.png.

% Figure legends should briefly describe the key messages of the figure such that the figure can stand alone from the main text. However, all figures should also be discussed in the article text. Each legend should have a concise title of no more than 15 words. The legend itself should be succinct, while still explaining all symbols and abbreviations. Avoid lengthy descriptions of methods.

% For any figures reproduced from another publication (as long as appropriate permission has been obtained from the copyright holder â€”see under the heading 'Submission'), please include a line in the legend to state that: 'This figure has been reproduced with kind permission from [include original publication citation]'.

% \begin{figure}
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{frog.jpg}
% \caption{\label{fig:your-figure}Your figure legend goes here; it should be succinct, while still explaining all symbols and abbreviations. }
% \end{figure}



% \subsection*{Mathematics}

% \LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
% $$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
%       = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
% denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

% \subsection*{Lists}

% You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{enumerate}
% \dots or bullet points \dots
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{itemize}

\section*{Methods}
% Methods should include a brief discussion of allowances made (if any) for controlling bias or unwanted sources of variability, and the limitations of the datasets.

\subsection*{Sites and Temperature Data}
Hourly air temperature data for 11 sites was downloaded from 
NOAA's Integrated Surface Database (ISD) dataset\cite{smith_integrated_2011,NOAA_ISD_portal}.
The airport sites shown in Table \ref{tab:sites}
were chosen for their biological relevance and 
availability of high quality hourly data over a long timeframe.

Data was fetched and parsed using the "Fetching and parsing ISH.ipynb" program.
Records for the same station callsign were merged, since identification, format, 
and precise location of stations has changed over the years.
The data was then cleaned using the 
"Cleaning temperatures.ipynb" program by 
removing outliers, 
identifying large gaps ($gt$ 3 hours), 
resampling to every hour on the hour using linear interpolation,
and filling the large gaps using day-over-day linear interpolation
(interpolating using values for the same hour of day from previous and following days).
The processing programs and resulting temperature datasets are 
provided in the Supplemental Materials with the intent that they 
may be adapted and used by others.


\subsection*{Degree-Day Calculation}
Degree-days were computed using 
foo\cite{Roltsch1999}

single-sine\cite{ECY:ECY1969503514}

single-triangle\cite{10.2307/1933072}
