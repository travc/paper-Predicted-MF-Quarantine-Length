Invasions by pest insects pose a significant threat to agriculture world-wide. In the case of
\emph{Ceratitis capitata} incursions on the US mainland, where it is not officially established,
repeated detections are followed by quarantines to eliminate the invading population.
However, it is notoriously difficult to set quarantine
duration because non-detection does not necessarily mean the pest is extirpated.
Most programs determine quarantine lengths 
by calculating the amount of time required for 3 generations to elapse under a thermal unit 
accumulation development model (``degree day''). 
A newer approach is to use an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) to 
explicitly simulate population demographics and extirpation.
Here, predicted quarantine lengths for 11 sites in the continental United States are evaluated.
Results indicate a strong seasonality in quarantine length, 
with longer predictions in the second half of the year compared with the first; 
this pattern is more extreme in degree day predictions compared with ABS.
Geographically, quarantine lengths increased with latitude, though again this feature was 
less pronounced under the ABS.
Variation in quarantine lengths for particular times and places was 
dramatically larger for degree day than ABS,
generally spiking in the middle of the year for degree day 
and peaking in second half of the year for ABS.
Analysis of 34 \emph{C. capitata} quarantines from 1975 to 2017 in California shows that 
all but two were declared in the second half of the year, 
when degree day quarantine lengths are longest and have the highest uncertainty.
For this set of hypothetical quarantines, 
the ABS produced significantly shorter quarantines than degree day calculations. 
Overall, ABS quarantine lengths were more consistent than degree day predictions,
avoided unrealistically long values seen in the northermost site studied (San Francisco), 
and realistically modeled the effects of rare events such as cold snaps.
%Results presented here should be useful to program managers and planners preparing for 
%detection and extirpation of \emph{C. capitata} in the mainland US.

\section*{Introduction}

Invasions by insects, pathogens and pests are increasingly a 
defining challenge of the 21\textsuperscript{st} century, 
facilitated by global connectivity, climatic shifts, and
other factors\cite{simberloff_impacts_2013,Pimentel2007}, with a particularly 
severe impact on agriculture\cite{paini2016global}.
Invasions by insects that do not become established have a lower public profile
than those that are ``successful'' from the point of view of the insect.
However, when the invading species is of environmental, human health, or 
economic concern there is a greater chance that cases of invasion followed 
by extirpation would be detected 
and studied\cite{liebhold_population_2008}.
Eradication of such insects can be desirable and 
feasible\cite{myers_eradication_2000} depending on several factors.

One factor is if the new environment is only marginally or 
seasonally suitable to the invading insect, facilitating its eradication.
Another is when the high cost of allowing establishment leads
to extensive efforts for eradication.
The invasion of the malaria mosquito species \textit{Anopheles gambiae}
into Northeastern Brazil in the 1930's\cite{soper_emphanopheles_1943}
is one example of an invasive insect that was successfully eradicated 
primarily due to the second of these
reasons\cite{causey_ecology_1943,killeen_eradication_2002}.

In the case of \textit{An. gambiae} there have been no reports of
reinvasion, but there are examples of insects that
recurrently invade areas outside their native range and are recurrently
extirpated within relatively few generations.
The Gypsy moth \textit{Lymantria dispar} in Canada\cite{gray_hitchhikers_2010} 
is one such species.
Arguably, another example is 
the screwworm \textit{Cochlyomyia hominivorax} along 
the current northernmost edge of its range in 
Panama\cite{robinson_enabling_2009}
and more recently in Florida\cite{matthews2017news}.

One of the most important instances of repeated invasion 
and extirpation by an economically important insect pest is that of 
the Mediterranean fruit fly \textit{Ceratitis capitata} (Wiedemann), aka. ``Medfly'', 
in California.  
The last four decades have seen a repeated pattern of
invasion, detection, and response 
interspersed by periods of no detections\cite{carey_establishment_1991, papadopoulos_trickle_2013}.
While it has been suggested that this pattern is the result of
cryptic establishment\cite{carey201730}, 
% Though the establishment of these pests is disputed, 
%  a pattern of invasion, detection, and response, 
%  followed by no further detections for a long period, 
%  has been established over the last four decades. 
the majority view is
that Medfly in California is an example of 
a ``metainvasion'', consisting of multiple sequential or
overlapping introductions\cite{davies_bioinvasions_1999}
and repeated eradication\cite{haymer_genetic_1997}.
Still other researchers point to the possibility of different situations
in different regions of the state
\cite{bonizzoni_microsatellite_2001,gasperi_genetic_2002}.
Medfly is occasionally found in 
other parts of the mainland US such as Florida\cite{szyniszewska2016analysis},
and in other countries or areas that are considered 
free of the pest including Australia, Mexico and Chile\cite{mcinnis2017can}.

The response plan to Medfly in California and the other ``free'' 
regions mentioned above is extensive and costly, 
including a quarantine when detections exceed an established threshold\cite{gilbert_insect_2013}.
A practical and important problem is how long to maintain 
the countermeasures and quarantine after flies are no longer detected.
Predicting the likely duration of required quarantines would help with
management decision-making and planning,
including potential cost savings by having sufficient but not excessive
resources available.

Currently most programs determine quarantine lengths 
by calculating the amount of time required for a given number 
of generations (usually three) to elapse under a thermal unit accumulation (``degree day'')
physiological development model.
Degree day based quarantine lengths have been codified in some legal
regulations, including 
United States Federal code\cite{US-301.32-10},
%(Title 7 Subtitle B Chapter III Part 301.32-10 Treatments),
California\cite{3-CA-ADC-3406}, and Florida.
However, the procedure prescribed only defines when the end of a
quarantine period has been reached after the fact.

For planning and resource allocation, policy makers and managers 
typically attempt to predict the quarantine lengths by using
normal temperatures for forward projection\cite{??}.
Although it frequently works fairly well,
this approach is mathematically flawed 
and also provides no indication as to the variance or uncertainty
of those predictions.
Even a more rigiourous treatment of degree day based values from
historical temperature data can produced highly variable results
depending on relatively small changes in temperatures or details of
the model formulation\cite{Roltsch1999}, in addition to neglecting
important aspects of the biology.

Recently, another approach to determining effective quarantine 
durations against Medfly via Agent-Based Simulations (ABS)\cite{manoukis_agent-based_2014}
was introduced. 
The MED-FOES system simulates a population of individual Medflies 
under inundative sterile insect technique (SIT) and other control, 
explicitly modeling extirpation as opposed to the degree day 
approach which only determines the time for a specific
number of generations to elapse to estimate quarantine duration.
MED-FOES also allows for the sampling of parameter space
(temperature dependent mortality for each stage, fecundity, etc.)
producing a distribution of possible outcomes.
While an ABS can be arbitarially complex, MED-FOES is parameterized
in such a way that it can model a `typical' or hypothetical outbreak from only hourly tempertuare data,
and is therefore similar to degree day methods in its input data requirements.
It is also possible to vary the initial population to model a specific outbreak, but
that is not how it is used here.

In this paper, predicted quarantine length (PQL for short) 
for 11 sites in the continental United States were analyzed
(\autoref{fig:sitemap} and \autoref{tab:sites})
based on both the standard thermal accumulation degree day method\cite{ECY:ECY1969503514} 
as well as the MED-FOES ABS\cite{manoukis_computer_2014}. 
Seasonal variation dominates quarantine duration, 
so we aggregated the PQL values for each day of the year 
(Jan.\ 1, Jan.\ 2, ect.) 
across a large number of years (65 for most locations) to produce normals.
This approach enables comparison of the standard degree day 
method to the ABS, but more importantly provides insight 
into seasonal and spatial variations, prediction uncertainties, 
and model reliability.


% @TCC -- Not sure we want to spend so much time on describing ABS
% 
% Agent-Based Simulations (ABS) 
% (also called ``Individual-Based'' or ``Multi-Agent''), 
% which can be defined as models where
% individuals are described as unique and autonomous, and where they usually
% interact with each other and their environment on a local level
% \cite{Railsback2011Agent}.
% Such simulations describe a system of interest 
% ``from the bottom up'': by implementing its constituent particles and
% then observing the system behaviors and dynamics that result from those
% particles interacting autonomously with their environment and often each other
% \cite{Bonabeau2002Agent}.
% These models can include arbitrary amounts of complexity, limited
% only by computational capacity, and are free of limitations imposed by 
% mathematical tractability\cite{Huston1988New}.
% 
% While the freedom to include any degree of complexity
% in an ABS comes at a cost
% \cite{Deangelis1994Individual,Grimm1999Ten,Hales2003Model}, 
% the pragmatic and paradigmatic benefits of an agent-based approach 
% can be significant for diverse areas of 
% biology\cite{Macal2010Tutorial,Railsback2011Agent},

% (but see\cite{crespo2011modeling} for an example).

\end{figure*}



\subsection*{Sites and Temperature Data}
Hourly air temperature data for 11 sites was downloaded from 
NOAA's Integrated Surface Database (ISD) dataset\cite{smith_integrated_2011,NOAA_ISD_portal}.
The airport sites shown in figure \ref{fig:sitemap} 
were chosen for their biological relevance and 
availability of high quality hourly data over a long time frame.

Sites are referred to here by the last three letters of the callsign shown in table \ref{tab:sites}.
For 8 sites (SFO, FAT, LAX, RIV, SAN, JAX, TPA, and MIA), temperature data starting on 1950-01-01 was used.
The 3 other sites contained large ($>$ 14 days) gaps or other problems in the early years of their data,
so data starting on 1970-01-01 for IAH and 1973-01-01 for BUR and MCO was used.
For all sites, temperature data from the start date through 2017-05-15 was used
to generate PQLs for dates ranging from the start date to 2016-01-01.

Data was fetched and parsed using the \texttt{Fetching and parsing ISH.ipynb} program.
Records for the same station callsign were merged, since identification, format, 
and precise location of stations has changed over the years.
The data was then cleaned using the 
\texttt{Cleaning temperatures.ipynb} program by 
removing outliers, 
identifying large gaps ($>$ 3 hours), 
resampling to every hour on the hour using linear interpolation,
and filling the large gaps using day-over-day linear interpolation
(interpolating using values for the same hour of day from previous and following days).
The processing programs and resulting temperature datasets are 
provided in the Supplemental Materials.


\subsection*{Degree-Day Calculation}
Degree-days were computed by the single-sine method\cite{ECY:ECY1969503514}
using a base development temperature of 12.39\degree C (53.3\degree F) 
and 345.56 degree-days Celsius (DDc; 622 DDf) per generation 
following the standard set by California Department of Food and Agriculture
regulation 3406(b)\cite{CDFA_Medfly,3-CA-ADC-3406}.
%single-triangle\cite{10.2307/1933072}
Since we have hourly temperature data, we also calculated degree-days by simple summation
for comparison\cite{Roltsch1999}.
For each date, the number of days required for 3 generations of degree-day 
based life cycles was computed.
These calculations are implemented in \texttt{Temperature functions.ipynb} in the Supplemental Materials.


\subsection*{Agent-based Simulations: MED-FOES}

MED-FOES\cite{manoukis_computer_2014,manoukis_agent-based_2014} is 
an agent-based simulation explicitly modeling the eradication of a population of Medflies 
under inundative sterile male releases (aka: sterile insect technique or SIT) and other interventions
such as increased trapping and foliar sprays.
A MED-FOES simulation models a single non-spatial population starting from a given age distribution 
and tracks the number of individuals through the time the population experiences extirpation when the last 
fly (Agent) dies.
The simulation is parameterized on the initial population, additional mortality induced by control efforts,
the effectiveness of SIT, and a large number of biological parameters for which ranges are known from 
the literature, including temperature-dependent development and mortality.
The simulations were performed using the same hourly timeseries of temperature values 
used for degree-day calculations.

Due to the fact that ranges can be estimated for many of the parameters,
2500 individual MED-FOES simulations were run for each start date at each site 
evenly sampling different regions of parameter-space via the 
Latin Hypercube Sampling\cite{10.2307/1403510} procedure.
This set of simulations, encompassing a range of possible extirpation outcomes, is referred to as a `run'.
%simulation -> run -> runset is the terminology I've been using
The number of days from the start date required for
95\% of the simulations in a run to reach extirpation is 
taken as a conservative prediction of needed quarantine length and referred to as ABS PQL.

Varying the start date for different simulations was achieved by simply 
starting at different points in the input temperature file; 
for this study a run starting every 7 days over the range of dates available for each site.
Each set of runs for a single site over a range of starting dates is referred to as a `runset'.
All runsets were conducted with the same input parameters aside from temperature.
Initial population numbers were chosen as a ``standard outbreak'' based on seven real 
outbreaks modeled previously\cite{manoukis_agent-based_2014}.
The 7 day interval ABS PQL values were upsampled to daily values using linear interpolation
to allow day-of-year aggregations across years and comparisons with daily degree day based PQLs.

MED-FOES version 0.6.2 was run under OGS/Grid Engine 2011.11 on a CentOS 6.6 HPC cluster.
The MED-FOES code, configuration files, and helper scripts are provided in the Supplemental Materials.
Overall, we created 11 runsets (one for each site), 
each containing runs starting every 7 days over the input temperature data range for that site,
where each run contained 2500 individual simulations sampling different regions of 
biologically plausible parameter space.


\subsection*{Statistical analysis}

The main results reported here are `normals' in a meteorological sense of term,
but without the typical running mean smoothing which would complicate
interpretation of the results.
For a variable of interest (eg. temperature or PQL), 
all values for the same calendar day irrespective of year (eg. 20-July) are
aggregated and summary statistics such as mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation 
are computed for each aggregation.
\texttt{Temperature functions.ipynb} contains the code used to perform normal calculations, 
and the code generating these figures is \texttt{Summary Figures.ipynb}.

The results reported here are the normals of PQL computed using the full temperature time series
as opposed to computing PQL from the normal of the temperature timeseries.
While the latter is fairly common practice, it is not mathematically proper 
since, as with means, the normal of a function of $X$ is not generally equal to the function applied to the normal of $X$.
Additionally, by computing the normals of the predicted quarantine durations, 
we can investigate properties of the distribution of values as shown in 
\autoref{fig:DD_variation_summary} and \autoref{fig:pe95_variation_summary} 
and the ``supernorm" supplemental figures 
S\ref{S:fig:temperature_supernorm}, 
S\ref{S:fig:ddPQL_supernorm},
and S\ref{S:fig:medfoesPQL_supernorm}.

%A list of 34 Medfly quarantines in CA dating from 1975 to early 2017 was obtained from

%can vary significantly over a short distance, especially between coastal and more 
%inland locations.

\section*{Results}


\autoref{fig:main_summary} shows 
the mean of the normal PQL based on 3 generation degree day accumulation 
and MED-FOES 95\% extirpation
along with the minimum and maximum of the normals for temperatures.
Figures \ref{fig:DD_variation_summary} and \ref{fig:pe95_variation_summary} show the 
standard deviations ($\sigma$) of the normals for the degree day and MED-FOES based PQL.

There is significant variation in PQL across both time and location.
The temporal variation in PQL is dominated by a yearly cycle, 
characterized by the normal values shown in figure \ref{fig:main_summary}.
Table \ref{tab:variance_captured_by_normal} shows the percentage of variance in 
quarantine length predictions, captured by the mean of the normal yearly cycle (aka. $R^2$) for each site.
At all but one site, greater than 75\% of the variance in both degree day and MED-FOES based PQL
is accounted for by the mean normal, and the majority exceed 90\%.
SFO is an exception to this common trend, with the mean normal accounting for only 9.1\% of the variation in 
degree day based PQL and 28.0\% of the MED-FOES based PQL.
This is also shown in the respective `supernorm' supplemental figures
S\ref{S:fig:ddPQL_supernorm},
and S\ref{S:fig:medfoesPQL_supernorm}.

\subsection*{Seasonal dependence}

Seasonal variation, evidenced by the general shape of the curves shown in figure \ref{fig:main_summary}, 
is doubtless familiar to anyone engaged in Medfly pest management.
Outbreaks starting in the late summer, autumn, or early winter will extend through relatively cold periods,
when thermal dependent development will be slow and therefore extend the duration of quarantine required
for 3 generations of degree days to accumulate (referred to as DD PQL hereafter).
Similarly, outbreaks starting in the spring or early summer often lead to short quarantines due
to the relatively high temperatures.

This familiar pattern is also seen in the MED-FOES ABS PQLs despite it being 
quite different in nature from simple degree day accumulation.
However, the MED-FOES predictions (pe95) show a smaller seasonal swing.
pe95 generally produces a smaller overall range of PQLs,
with longer quarantines than DD PQL for spring and early summer outbreaks,
and shorter quarantines for late summer through early winter in almost all cases.

A particular feature of interest, shown most dramatically at FAT in figure \ref{fig:main_summary},
is that ABS PQL often flattens out or even dips for quarantines starting in the late 
autumn or early winter.  This can be due to relatively rare and brief cold-snaps,
normally lasting only a few hours, which increase mortality.
Since DD PQL does not account for mortality, it misses the effect of cold-snaps entirely.
This cold-snap effect is most clearly seen at more northern and 
inland sites where cold-snaps are more likely: 
particularly FAT and RIV, but also BUR, LAX, JAX, and IAH.

\subsection*{Geographic dependence}

and MED-FOES based predictions are in the right pane.
}
\end{figure*}

PQL generally shows a positive correlation with latitude\cite{??}.
Sites are ordered by latitude in the figures and tables.
As seen in figure \ref{fig:main_summary}, higher latitude sites tend to have longer PQL 
as well as larger seasonal swings for both degree day and MED-FOES based predictions.

Figure \ref{fig:latitude_trend} shows the relationship between PQL and latitude.
An ordinary least squares fit to the median PQL at each site shows a significant slope for
both DD PQL ($F{=}14.08$, $p{=}0.005$) and ABS PQL ($F{=}10.55$, $p{=}0.010$), but
the degree day based predictions are more sensitive to latitude than MED-FOES
(coefficients of 17.39 and 4.78 respectively).
Additionally, MED-FOES predictions are more stable for SFO, and to a lesser extent FAT, 
where the degree day model for Medfly produced PQLs that appear either unrealistically long (SFO) 
or are subject to rapid and extreme seasonal variation in the mid year (FAT).

In addition to the variation associated with latitude, 
large differences in PQLs computed for the same start date 
can exist between even relatively nearby sites.
For example, the differences in both degree day and MED-FOES PQLs 
for the three sites in the Los Angeles region (LAX, BUR, RIV) 
(shown in the supplemental figure \ref{sfig:??})
show a strong seasonal component with a spike in July and/or August.
The difference in DD PQL between LAX and BUR is normally about a month
(overall median=35 days; overall 25\% \& 75\% quantiles are 28 \& 45 days), 
but the median difference of the normal exceeds 75 days in August with some 
PQL differences up to 142 days.
Differences in MED-FOES PQLs are more seasonally stable, 
with the LAX minus BUR (MEAN?) difference not exceeding 42 days at its maximum.

\end{figure*}


Figures \ref{fig:DD_variation_summary} and \ref{fig:pe95_variation_summary}
report the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the normal for DD PQL and MED-FOES PQL 
respectively.
These indicate the year to year variability of the PQL for outbreaks starting at a
given time of the year and can be used to gauge the uncertainty of quarantine 
length predictions relative to the actual quarantine length which will be required.
Similar information is represented by the inter-quartile ranges 
shown in figure \ref{fig:latitude_trend} and the `supernorm' supplemental figures.
Those `supernorm' figures also show that the underlying distributions of PQL 
values are generally not highly skewed, making $\sigma$ a relatively easy to interpret 
proxy for uncertainty.

Excluding SFO, the mean normal is a good predictor of DD PQL with $\sigma$ values below 20 days
except for the late summer and early autumn, where variance increases 
due to quarantines extending through the cold season.
FAT and, to a lesser extent, RIV show this increase more dramatically, presumably due to their more 
arid/inland climates where both daily and seasonal temperature ranges are larger
(also see figure \ref{fig:main_summary}).
The standard deviation generally decreases with decreasing latitude, together with reduced means.
The standard deviation in DD PQL for SFO shows a inversion of the seasonal trend 
other sites exhibit.
This is due to the colder temperatures leading to extremely long DD PQLs, 
frequently extending across two winter seasons.

The standard deviations of MED-FOES based PQL normals 
shown in figure \ref{fig:pe95_variation_summary}
are generally about \nicefrac{1}{2} as large as for DD PQL.
This indicates that MED-FOES PQL not only shows less dramatic seasonal swings, 
but is also produces more consistent predictions across years.
Values again generally decrease with latitude, but less consistently than DD PQL $\sigma$ of normals.
Also, unlike with the DD PQL, the results for SFO appear consistent with other sites.

A notable feature is that BUR, LAX, and SAN all show an increase in the year to year variation
in MED-FOES PQL starting in July and extending through November, 
while that increase for all other sites starts in July or August 
but extends to January or February.
Additionally, results for FAT show a sharp increase in uncertainty starting in September, fitting with the 
more aird/inland climate.  RIV shows a significant but more gradual increase.

\subsection*{Historical quarantines}

34 Medfly quarantines in CA dating from 1975 to early 2017 were analyzed (supplemental table ??).
All but two of these quarantines were declared in the latter half of the year
(July through December) when DD PQLs are typically relatively long,
with 68\% ($23/34$) occurring in September through October (when DD PQLs are
longest). 
August, the month where uncertainty in DD PQL often spikes 
(see figure \ref{fig:DD_variation_summary}), 
accounts for 30\% ($7/34$) of historic quarantines.

DD PQLs and ABS PQLs were computed using the start date for each historic
quarantine and the temperature data from the closest site of the 11 analyzed
here (see supplemental table ??).
For this set of hypothetical quarantines, 
MED-FOES produced significantly shorter quarantines
(mean=169.7 days, $\sigma$=21.8 days)
than simple 3 generation degree day accumulation
(mean=234.2 days, $\sigma$=79.2 days)
(t-statistic=6.01, $p<10^{-5}$).
Additionally, the variance in the difference between quarantine lengths
using a specific date and the mean of the normal PQL for that day of year
were smaller for MED-FOES ($\sigma$=8.2 days)
than with degree day ($\sigma$=25.9 days)
(F-statistic=9.92, $p<10^{-8}$).

\section*{Discussion}
% The discussion should include the implications of the article results in view of prior work in this field.

The principal contributions of this work can be broken down into three categories: 
1) Comparison of PQLs as determined by the degree day and ABS methods. 
2) variation in average PQLs across time of year and space, and
3) variation in PQLs within a time of year and location.
Consideration of all three of these by program managers, planners and other decision makers 
is likely to improve quarantines by informing resource allocation ahead of outbreaks, reducing 
quarantine costs in some cases, and reducing risk from premature quarantine suspension in others. 
The results presented cover most of the latitudinal range 
of Medfly suitability within the United States 
as well as many sites of probable introduction,
and will hopefully find use as a general guide.

% overall comparison of DD and ABD PQLs here.

Extirpation models are extremely difficult to test for accuracy given 
the impracticality of experimental introductions and 
the sparse and idiosyncratic nature of historic outbreaks. However, analyzing locations
of historic outbreaks suggests that quarantine lengths would generally be more consistent
and shorter on average in California if estimated by ABS compared with degree day. 

Requiring a fixed number (typically 3) generations of degree days to pass is 
a "tried and true" method, but not explicitly an extirpation model.
It may overestimate required quarantine length through cold weather\cite{??}
and may underestimate length when growth conditions are very favorable, 
which somewhat paradoxically leads to quicker extirpation under SIT (CITE?).
%However, the simplicity of degree day and the "has worked so far" nature
%means it will likely continue to be the regulatory benchmark.
However, the simplicity of the degree day calculation is a point in its favor, together with 
its record of generally avoiding subsequent detections after quarantine\cite{mcinnis2017can}.

ABS results may be used to inform and modulate responses and treatments which are under
the discretion of managers.
In situations where DD PQL greatly exceed those from MED-FOES, it is likely
that degree day is missing important effects such as cold snaps which may justify
shortening quarantine periods.
On the other hand, in cases where MED-FOES predicts longer times to extirpation, it
is plausible that the degree day indicated quarantine is short, and 
eradication treatments and SIT releases should be conducted aggressively.


A few specific results arising from overall comparisons of different locations are worth highlighting. 
In general, DD PQL for Medfly 
generated from San Francisco International Airport temperature data
 are almost certainly too long for the entire year.
The ABS PQLs are flatter and seem more realistic at around 200 days for San
Fransisco compared with the 400-550 days of DD PQLs. 
For several other California locations (typified by Fresno and 
Riverside) DD PQLs are in close alignment with those from the ABS 
for the first half of the year 
but go significantly longer in the cooler months. 
For three of four Florida locations analyzed, 
DD PQLs are significantly shorter than the ABS results
 (Miami, Tampa, and Orlando).
The extent of the difference in those Florida locations is smaller in the later months of the year,
but the generality of this pattern suggests that the margin of safety for quarantines as 
calculated by degree day in those locations may be smaller than expected. 

Other systematic comparisons of (PQLs? development?) include .. (PLUG Davis paper here) 
% Are there other papers we should compare with here? I would guess yes...


As expected, there is significant variation in PQL depending on the location of the outbreak, 
with the extremes in our study sites represented by Miami and San Francisco.
These geographic results could be
compared directly to previous efforts to model climatic suitability of different parts of the US 
for Medfly, by equating longer PQLs with higher climatic suitability.
One of the early studies on the subject focused on Medfly found higher climatic suitability in 
Florida locations (Fort Pierce and Orlando) compared with California 
sites\cite{messenger_bioclimatic_1954}. 
Within California, however, those authors found a higher number of suitable months in coastal 
areas such as Oceanside compared with Riverside and Fresno, roughly paralleling our 
findings (compare Los Angeles or San Diego with Fresno or Riverside).
A more recent analysis of climatic suitability likewise concludes that coastal 
S. California is the most favorable area of the state for Medfly, but 
favorability drops inland in the south due to desert conditions.
Suitability in central and northern California is limited by cold temperatures and 
freezes\cite{gutierrez_assessing_2011}.

% variation within location/time
An important aspect of PQLs from the ABS is variation within particular times of years and locations. 
Rare events like cold snaps can increase mortality in the ABS,
and thereby lead to shorter PQLs than expected based on historical averages, or DD PQLs.
The specificity of the ABS is helpful for determining 
when quarantines might be safely suspended due to a rare event,
something that might not be captured by the degree day model.
The degree day model includes only development for generating PQLs,
and development is halted at low temperatures, extending quarantine lengths.
The ABS, however, also includes mortality for generating PQLs,
which means that low temperatures can significantly reduce estimates.
% perhaps name names of locations
% where the variation is particularly acute (like FAT?)
% Possibly put a paragraph on variation in PQLs seen in figs 3,4- patterns different for ABS vs DD

In California, historically quarantines have most frequently occurred at times of year when 
degree day based quarantines are drawn out by cold weather and the MED-FOES ABS model predicts significantly
shorter durations.
Furthermore, 30\% of those historic quarantines happened in August where there is a great 
deal of uncertainty in forward predictions of degree day quarantine durations based on normal values.
If we assume those historic CA quarantines are a guide, the ABS model would very likely
produced more predictable and shorter quarantine durations for future outbreaks.



%%%%%

%By expanding on previous work\cite{manoukis_agent-based_2014}, this study suggests that an 
%improved approach to setting quarantine lengths would 
%include estimates from the DD method and from the ABS.

The initial quarantine length estimate could be quickly produced based on the distribution of PQL values
generated using historical temperatures.
This would generate not just a single ``typical'' value as the current method of projecting
using historical average/normal temperatures does.
The median ``most likely'' value may be used for official estimates, while
the variance and extremes would provide managers and affected parties additional
information vital for planning.

Once the eradication program is underway, weekly simulations
via the ABS could indicate the likelihood that extirpation has been achieved. If the threshold 
95\% extirpation is observed the decision to end quarantine early could be made, or in the case 
where the ABS has not reached the 95\% threshold at the end of the DD PQL additional measures could 
be considered to reduce the risk of re-detection.
