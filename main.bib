abstract="{\enspace}Procedures for estimating degree-day accumulations are frequently employed instead of the more accurate method of calculating degree-days from hourly temperature data because on-site temperature data are commonly restricted to daily minimum and maximum temperature records. Data from seven methods of estimating degree-days at each of nine locations during 2 years in California were compared by month to degree-day values calculated by hourly summation. Methods included three sine-wave approaches, three triangulation approaches and the averaging (i.e., rectangle) method. Results of the double-sine and corrected-sine (i.e., corrected for day length) methods were nearly identical to those of the single-sine method. The double triangulation and corrected triangulation methods produced very similar results to the single triangulation method. The averaging method and sine-wave methods deviated to a greater extent from degree-day accumulations calculated from hourly temperatures from November through February than did the triangulation methods. Degree-day estimations from the late spring and summer months were more similar to one another for all estimation methods than during the cooler months of the year. Since no advantages were noted in the more complicated double and corrected methods, the single triangulation method or the sine-wave method is preferred as they are less complicated procedures. Of the various temperature threshold cut-off methods evaluated, error levels were unaffected when estimating degree-days using the sine-wave method. The employment of a horizontal cut-off with the triangulation method did not significantly increase the amount of error in the estimation of degree-days. However, an increase in error was observed when employing the intermediate cut-off and vertical threshold cut-off techniques with the triangulation method for computing degree-days.",

    abstract = {Attractant-based trap networks are important elements of invasive insect detection, pest control, and basic research programs. We present a landscape-level, spatially explicit model of trap networks, focused on detection, that incorporates variable attractiveness of traps and a movement model for insect dispersion. We describe the model and validate its behavior using field trap data on networks targeting two species, Ceratitis capitata and Anoplophora glabripennis. Our model will assist efforts to optimize trap networks by 1) introducing an accessible and realistic mathematical characterization of the operation of a single trap that lends itself easily to parametrization via field experiments and 2) allowing direct quantification and comparison of sensitivity between trap networks. Results from the two case studies indicate that the relationship between number of traps and their spatial distribution and capture probability under the model is qualitatively dependent on the attractiveness of the traps, a result with important practical consequences.},

    abstract = {We present an agent-based simulation (ABS) of Ceratitis capitata (“Medfly”) developed for estimating the time to extirpation of this pest in areas where quarantines and eradication treatments were immediately imposed. We use the ABS, implemented in the program MED-FOES, to study seven different outbreaks that occurred in Southern California from 2008 to 2010. Results are compared with the length of intervention and quarantine imposed by the State, based on a linear developmental model (thermal unit accumulation, or “degree-day”). MED-FOES is a useful tool for invasive species managers as it incorporates more information from the known biology of the Medfly, and includes the important feature of being demographically explicit, providing significant improvements over simple degree-day calculations. While there was general agreement between the length of quarantine by degree-day and the time to extirpation indicated by MED-FOES, the ABS suggests that the margin of safety varies among cases and that in two cases the quarantine may have been excessively long. We also examined changes in the number of individuals over time in MED-FOES and conducted a sensitivity analysis for one of the outbreaks to explore the role of various input parameters on simulation outcomes. While our implementation of the ABS in this work is motivated by C. capitata and takes extirpation as a postulate, the simulation is very flexible and can be used to study a variety of questions on the invasion biology of pest insects and methods proposed to manage or eradicate such species.},

 abstract = {HIV transmission models have become very complex. The behavior of some of these models may only be explored by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, because the structural complexity of the model are coupled with a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the values of the input parameters. Uncertainty analysis may be used to assess the variability (prediction imprecision) in the outcome variable that is due to the uncertainty in estimating the input values. A sensitivity analysis can extend an uncertainty analysis by identifying which parameters are important in contributing to the prediction imprecision (i.e., how do changes in the values of the input parameters alter the value of the outcome variable). In this paper an uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis are described and applied; both analyses are based upon the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) scheme, which is an extremely efficient sampling design proposed by McKay, Conover \& Beckman (1979). The methods described in this paper have not previously been applied to deterministic models of disease transmission, although these models have many characteristics in common with the risk assessment models that the strategies were designed to investigate. The utility of the LHS uncertainty and the LHS/PRC (Latin Hypercube Sampling/Partial Rank Correlation) sensitivity analysis techniques are illustrated by analyzing a complex deterministic model of HIV transmission. /// Les modèles d'étude de la diffusion du VIH sont devenus très complexes. Cette complexité étant associée à une forte incertitude dans l'estimation des valeurs des paramètres d'entrée, le comportement de certains de ces modèles ne peut être appréhendé que par des analyses d'incertitude et de sensibilité. L'analyse d'incertitude peut être utilisée pour établir la variabilité (imprécision de la prédiction) de la variable de sortie qui provient de l'incertitude de l'estimation des paramètres d'entrée. Une analyse de sensibilité peut compléter celle d'incertitude en identifiant les paramètres qui ont une influence maximale sur l'imprécision de la prévision (i.e., étude de l'impact des modifications des valeurs des paramètres d'entrée sur la valeur de la variable de sortie). Dans cet article, des analyses d'incertitude et de sensibilité sont décrites et leurs applications sont présentées; les deux analyses s'appuient sur la méthode d'Echantillonnage des Carrés Latins (ECL) qui est un protocole d'échantillonnage extrêmement efficace proposé par McKay, Conover \& Beckman (1979). Les méthodes présentées dans ce papier n'ont jamais été appliquées aux modèles déterministes de la dynamique de la diffusion d'une maladie, même si ces modèles ont de nombreuses caractéristiques en commun avec les modèles d'estimation du risque pour lesquelles ces stratégies ont été développées. L'intérêt des analyses d'incertitude par le ECL et de la sensibilité par le ECL/CPR (Echantillonnage des Carrés Latins/Corrélation Partielle de Rang) est mise en évidence par l'analyse d'un modèle déterministe complexe de transmission du VIH.},
